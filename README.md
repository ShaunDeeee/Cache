# Cache
Technical test implementing a cache component. 
Used .NET 8 (.NET CORE)
Time taken: 4 hours. 
Stopped at this point and didnt add additional features like:
The Threadsafe _lock or:
Mechanism to notify when an item gets evicted(Although I did add a Console.WriteLine I'm not seeing it actually being printed so needs debugging)

Testable in Swagger for GET and POST endpoints
